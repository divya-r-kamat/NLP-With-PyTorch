## Unsupervised Clustering Method
- LDA is an unsupervised clustering method.
- K-Means Clustering is one of the most well-known unsupervised clustering methods.
- In contrast to K-means clustering, where each word can only belong to one cluster (hard-clustering), LDA allows for ‘fuzzy’ memberships (soft clustering). Soft-clustering allows overlap among the cluster, whereas, in hard-clustering, clusters are mutually exclusive. What does this mean? In LDA, a word can belong to more than one group while this is not possible in K-Means clustering. In LDA, this trade-off makes it easier to find similarities between the words. However, this soft-clustering makes it hard to obtain distinct groups because the same words can appear in different groups.
